Python C Mix
Programming languages are crucial tools for the creation of software. The two most well-liked programming languages are C and Python.
However, what is the difference between C and Python? To assist you in choosing which language to utilize for your next Data Science project, we will examine the Python vs C and the disparities between the two languages in this blog, along with some examples.
Introduction to C
C language, created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, is a cornerstone in programming. Renowned for its efficiency and versatility, C has been a driving force behind modern software development. Its concise syntax, and powerful capabilities have enabled the creation of everything from operating systems to embedded systems.
With a focus on control structures and memory manipulation, C remains a fundamental educational language and an essential tool for professionals, shaping the digital landscape and influencing subsequent languages. Its enduring legacy underscores its significance in the ever-evolving world of programming.
Introduction to Python
Python, a dynamic and high-level programming language, has swiftly emerged as a favorite for developers and beginners since its inception in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. Known for its readability and elegant syntax, Python emphasizes code clarity and ease of use, fostering rapid development across various applications.
Python's vast libraries and community support simplify complex tasks, from web development to data analysis and AI. Its versatility and gentle learning curve have made Python an essential tool for innovation, propelling it to the forefront of modern programming languages.
Now let’s take a look at the difference between Python and C:
In this tutorial you are going to learn about the Naive Bayes algorithm including how it works and how to implement it from scratch in Python (without libraries).
We can use probability to make predictions in machine learning. Perhaps the most widely used example is called the Naive Bayes algorithm. Not only is it straightforward to understand, but it also achieves surprisingly good results on a wide range of problems.
After completing this tutorial you will know:
How to calculate the probabilities required by the Naive Bayes algorithm.
How to implement the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.
How to apply Naive Bayes to a real-world predictive modeling problem.
Kick-start your project with my new book Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
Let’s get started.
Update Dec/2014: Original implementation.
Update Oct/2019: Rewrote the tutorial and code from the ground-up.
