("in this post i'd like to discuss the concepts of type erasure and reification in programming languages. i don't intend to dive very deeply into the specific rules of any particular language; rather, the post is going to present several simple examples in multiple languages, hoping to provide enough intuition and background for a more serious study, if necessary. as you'll see, the actual concepts are very simple and familiar. deeper details of specific languages pertain more to the idiosyncrasies of those languages' semantics and implementations.",1),
("important note: in c++ there is a programming pattern called type erasure , which is quite distinct from what i'm trying to describe here [1] . i'll be using c++ examples here, but that's to demonstrate how the original concepts apply in c++. the programming pattern will be covered in a separate post.",1),

("the title of this section is a \"one short sentence\" explanation of what type erasure means. with few exceptions, it only applies to languages with some degree of compile time (a.k.a. static ) type checking. the basic principle should be immediately familiar to folks who have some idea of what machine code generated from low-level languages like c looks like. while c has static typing, this only matters in the compiler - the generated code is completely oblivious to types.",1),

("in general, type erasure is a concept that descibes these semantics of a language. types matter to the compiler, which uses them to generate code and help the programmer avoid errors. once everything is type-checked, however, the types are simply erased and the code the compiler generates is oblivious to them. the next section will put this in context by comparing to the opposite approach.",1),
("reification - retaining types at run-time",0),

("the first call will successfully invoke derivedfunc ; the second will not, because the dynamic_cast will return nullptr at run-time. this is because we're using c++'s run-time type information (rtti) capabilities here, where an actual representation of the type is stored in the generated code (most likely attached to the vtable which every polymorphic object points to). c++ also has the typeid feature, but i'm showing dynamic_cast since it's the one most commonly used.",1),
("note particularly the differences between this sample and the c sample in the beginning of the post. conceptually, it's similar - we use a pointer to a general type (in c that's void* , in the c++ example we use a base type) to interact with concrete types. whereas in c there is no built-in run-time type feature, in c++ we can use rtti in some cases. with rtti enabled, dynamic_cast can be used to interact with the run-time (reified) representation of types in a limited but useful way.",1),
("type erasure and java generics",0),
("one place where folks not necessarily familiar with programming language type theory encounter erasure is java generics, which were bolted onto the language after a large amount of code has already been written. the designers of java faced the binary compatibility challenge, wherein they wanted code compiled with newer java compilers to run on older vms.",1),

("here list is a container of object , so we can assign any element to it (similarly to the reification example shown in the previous section). the compiler then inserts a cast when accessing that element as a string. in this case the compiler will adamantly preserve type safety and won't let us do list.add(5) in the original snippet, because it sees that list is a list<string> . therefore, the cast to (string) should be safe.",1),
("using type erasure to implement generics with backwards compatibility is a neat idea, but it has its issues. some folks complain that not having the types available at runtime is a limitation (e.g. not being able to use instanceof and other reflection capabilities). other languages, like c# and dart 2, have reified generics which do preserve the type information at run-time.",1),
