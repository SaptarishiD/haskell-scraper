# Project: Scraper
Develop a scraper using Haskell to extract text and code snippets separately. 
1. Input: Scrape the text and code snippets from the given text source: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/type-erasure-and-reification/ \ 
2. Output: A Word document containing the text and .txt file containing the code. 
3. Method: write the algorithm to scrape (you can use the tagsoup library) and all the input-output
facilities using Haskell. Do not use any other language.
