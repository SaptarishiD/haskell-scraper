# Assigned Project Statement: Scraper
Develop a scraper using Haskell to extract text and code snippets separately. 
1. Input: Scrape the text and code snippets from a given text source.
2. Output: A Word document containing the text and .txt file containing the code. 
3. Method: write the algorithm to scrape (you can use the tagsoup library) and all the input-output
facilities using Haskell. Do not use any other language. 

The scraper/src folder contains the implementation of the main library functions

scraper/app contains the driver code

scraper/tests contains the tests

input has the training data and some input samples

cases has the evaluation tests

List of Haskell dependencies can be found in the package.yaml file
